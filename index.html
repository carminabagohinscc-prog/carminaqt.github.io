    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day, Mahal!</h1>
    <p><i>
      Mahal, This is my first valentine's day as your girlfriend and I just want you to know how grateful I am to have you in my life. Thank you for being patient with me, for understanding me and supporting me. Thank you for staying, for choosing me, and for loving me even on days when I’m not at my best. I love how strong you are, kahit minsan hindi mo nakikita yon sa sarili mo. You inspire me in ways you don’t even realize. Pipiliin kita kahit anong mangyari, mahal ko. To more valentine's day with you mahal. I love you with all my heart, Jincy ko! 👰🤍
